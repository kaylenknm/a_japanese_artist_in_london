                    <strong>Process Narrative</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">At the beginning of the semester, when the class was deciding which individual they would base their project on, I felt drawn to Markino’s insatiable need to involve himself in such a variety of creative expressions. His paintings so perfectly captured the rainy atmosphere of London, and I discovered that I wanted to know more about this Japanese explorer and his experiences with the west. But he was more than just a painter; he was also a writer, a social commentator, and an avid participant in the culture of London. At this moment, I had only gotten a cursory glance of Yoshio Markino, but I was hooked.<br><div><br></div><div>The semester continued, and the class as a whole started to think about how to build their projects. We had done numerous readings about how to analyze our digital projects in various ways, which included anything from critically assessing the accessibility of the site to thinking about how our own biases impacted the way in which we developed and presented information. I was eager to start using these ideas and strategies within a real project. Along with these critical readings, the class began to experiment with technological tools and platforms (such as Mobiries and Wordpress⁠—original reviews posted below) that could be used to create the project or project materials.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Around this time, I created a basic plan for how I wanted to build the project. I wanted a main hub site containing the basic materials (Biography, Author’s Works, Project Information) and then links going outward to the more creative sides of the project (these resulted in the Timeline Map, the Virtual Museum, and the Watercolor Blog). I had the idea for the Watercolor Blog pretty early on and began to gather materials (research about how Markino painted and the physical materials needed to paint) and plan out the specific paintings. I chose each painting due to the different types of styles and techniques I would be able to try. The paintings took me most of the semester, and it wasn’t until they were finished that I began to add the corresponding text and incorporate some of the research I had found into the blog.</div><div><br></div><div>The Virtual Museum was the first part of the project that got developed. It began when the class first started to look at various tools on the internet, and I ran across a site called Twine, where people built the “choose your own adventure” stories. I thought that the program could be easily utilized for developing a virtual space where the user could choose which way to go from room to room. Before doing any of the work on the site itself, I chose the paintings that I wanted to put in the museum and created a map (drawn on paper), segmenting them into different organized collections. I then drew up a digital map. The way Twine works is that you create a card for each page, and you can add images and formatting into those pages via code. To convert the image into code, I used a Base64 image encoder. Needless to say, I did a lot of googling to figure out how things worked.</div><div><br></div><div>T<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">hese were the two aspects of the project that I worked on for most of the semester while also developing the weekly assignments, which included, but were not limited to, the identity statement, the intervention statement, and the value statement. The value statement was extremely useful as it helped me to reexamine my focus on the project and realize that I needed to do more research of what other activities Markino was involved in besides writing and painting in order to stress his position as a multi-faceted individual. Due to this I added information about his role in theater, and it eventually led to a revision of Yoshio Markino’s short biography on the main page.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>It wasn’t until about a month from the end of the semester that I began to build the main page of the site, but it was mostly a matter of inserting the materials that I had already developed and messing with the design of the website. A lot of thought went into the backgrounds and the images. I decided that I wanted to use Markino’s own paintings as page backgrounds in order to emphasize his role as an artist and to create the aesthetic of the site. From there, I created the Timeline Map and began to input the links to make the project whole. Even then, I did not stop constantly revising and adding new things to the project. I always had a long list of things to do that never seemed to end. I believe that the most important thing I learned about the digital humanities field is to always take notes when you get an idea and to keep your files organized. It will result in a lot less headaches and desperate attempts to remember something that you probably never will.&nbsp;</div></h4>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Mobirise makes it relatively easy to design a nice, clean website. I really like the way that you can add different block styles to a page that best fits your needs. It makes a lot of sense since you essentially can add a little bit at a time that is “separate” from the rest of the page making it easier to interact with particular sections. Because it is done in this way, the different elements do not overlap with one another with plenty of space in between them. The site, then, does not look chaotic and users will not get too overwhelmed by a messy website design. It is harder to accomplish the same slim design using html. When working with html, it is harder to get the placement right because you cannot see how it looks as you are adjusting the code. Additionally, Mobirise provides built in headers and footers where you can access different parts to a site which I think would be complicated to code in html. In terms of building a website, the platform makes it easy to place text, links, and photos without having to put in the hassle of coding yourself. The main issue I had with Mobirise was getting it to publish on GitHub. When I drop it in as the presentation described all I get is a 404 error. When I download it as a whole bunch of files all I have been able to get is a website with the text without the fancy layout or the photos. I have linked this below. Because it’s so complicated, I feel like I have missed something to upload into the repository. Additionally, I created two pages on Mobirise, but all I have been able to access is the home page.<br> 
<br>My personal experience with Mobirise has been frustrating. I feel like I don’t have quite enough knowledge in the field for me to adjust when a problem occurs and finding a workaround on the internet has proved unfruitful. I found html simple and straightforward even though when I use it I wouldn’t have access to all the fancy shortcuts of designing a site. Then again, maybe my frustration should be more directed at GitHub as the problem than mobirise, but I would not know.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Wordpress makes it easy to make a website with a clean look. It works in a block format, just like Mobirise, which makes it fairly easy to organize and to work with. The site allows you to move blocks around if the creator wants to shift the information around by clicking up and down arrows while within that particular block. Mobirise has a similar function except you must drag the block up or down. Personally, I find the Wordpress method easier simply because dragging the block can become difficult if the computer is acting up and could easily end up placing the block where its unwanted. The simple click method makes this less likely to become a problem.<br> 
<br>One thing about Wordpress is that it is a bit more complicated to change the font than Mobiris or html. As I understand it, in Wordpress you have to go through the style editor which is a little convoluted to get to and changes the font on a global scale or you have to mess with the code directly. In Mobirise, you can change the font within the text block and in html you need only to specify the font when coding. But overall I do find Wordpress easier to work with, especially in regards to adding widgets and toolbars. I don't see an easy way to do it on Mobirise and html would require a more expansive knowledge of coding in order to accomplish it. 
<br><br>I think that Wordpress would work well to build websites for an image gallery or a repository for various written works. I think html would be the best to create the "main" site with links to the other sources just because it wouldn't need to be super complicated to serve its purpose. Wordpress and Mobirise are built so that they can easily have different pages to a website but that would be completely unnecessary  when all you are doing is providing a whole bunch of links. In my practice Wordpress session, I have already begun to mess around with building a website for Markino's written works. The main page offers a brief overview of Markino and then has page headings at the top depending on what the user is looking for. I have already provided a link in Autobiographical Pieces, although I would like to figure out how to embed the document.&nbsp;<br></p>
